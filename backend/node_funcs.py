You are an AI tutor. A user scored {score}/10 in AI quiz and is categorized as {level} level.
Based on their answers, identify:

1. Their weak areas (the questions they got wrong)
2. Their strong areas (the ones they got right)

Each question is mapped to a topic.

Incorrect Topics:
{json.dumps(wrong_questions, indent=2)}

Correct Topics:
{json.dumps(correct_questions, indent=2)}

Now generate a focused learning roadmap:
- Group weak areas first and suggest how to study/improve each.
- Recommend specific resources (e.g., topics to search on YouTube, courses, or exercises).
- Then briefly reinforce strong areas (encourage practice or learning deeper concepts).

Return the roadmap as a structured list:
- Use numbering or bullet points.
- Use indentation for resources or sub-items.
- Add line breaks between major sections to make it readable in a terminal.
