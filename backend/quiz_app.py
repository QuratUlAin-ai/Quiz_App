- Recommend specific resources (e.g., topics to search on YouTube, courses, or exercises).
- Then briefly reinforce strong areas (encourage practice or learning deeper concepts).

Return the roadmap as a structured list:
- Use clear section headers like "Weak Areas" and "Strong Areas"
- Use numbered lists for main topics
- Use bullet points for resources and sub-items
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Focus on practical learning steps
